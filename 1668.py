#Instruction: solve with dp to get a O(MN) solution, while I believe the worst case time complexity is better than 'word*n in sequence' solution,
#the Leetcode server might not agree.
#Think about when a letterwise comparison fails, where can't start from the next uncompared one. i.e. when squence[i] != word[j] the next comparison should be
#sequence[i+1] vs word[0] or sequence[i-j+1] vs word[0]ï¼Ÿ
